- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression Models
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix

### Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Results
Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 82% and ROC-AUC of 89.7%.

### Dataset
